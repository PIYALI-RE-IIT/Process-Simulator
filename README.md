### About the Experiment 
**System description**

The process control simulator utilizes integrated circuit operational amplifiers for specialized analog simulation. Its numerous variable interconnections, coupled with a selection of non-linear functions, enable in-depth exploration of both linear and non-linear process dynamics. Furthermore, it facilitates the implementation and analysis of proportional, integral, 
and derivative control modes. 

<b >Functional Description</b>

Fig. 1 shows the panel layout. 
A power on-off switch and an indicator lamp are mounted on the left hand side of the case. Range of all input and output signals is &plusmn; 10 V.

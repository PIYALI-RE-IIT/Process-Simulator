**Steps to perform the simulation**

<b style="color:blue">P-Control</b>

1. At first connect the circuit diagram properly through the connecting dots(blue dots)in the Process Simulator kit below the oscilloscope section,according to below instruction.
2-7,8-9,10-11,12-13,21-22,23-24,37-38,39-40,28-29,25-26,23-42,44-42,46-43,46-25 and 32-35 for proportional control.45-22,45-27 connections can be done for showing output signal or deviation signal respectively in oscilloscope channel-2 alternatively.
  
2. Click on 'Check Connection' button to check whether the connection is proper or not.Then click on the 'Power' button to switch on the oscilloscope.
					 
3. Click on "Square" button(twice) to observe input signal. Apply amplitude to 5v<sub>p-p</sub>,Frequency 0.2Hz.
					 
4. Apply 50 percent proportional band by rotating the 'proportional band' knob by clicking on the plus sign on it.

5. Now click on 'Output' button to observe the output signal for that perticular proportional band.Channel-1 will show the input,Channel-2 will show the output and 'Dual' shows the both.Check output for 30,200,5 percent proportional band in same way.

1. At first connect the circuit diagram properly through the connecting dots(blue dots)in the Process Simulator kit below the oscilloscope section,according to below instruction.2-7,8-9,10-11,12-13,21-22,23-24,37-38,39-40,28-29,25-26,23-42,44-42,46-43,46-25 and 32-35,30-31 for proportional Integral control.45-22,45-27 connections can be done for showing output signal or deviation signal respectively in oscilloscope channel-2 alternatively.
  
2. Click on 'Check Connection' button to check whether the connection is proper or not.Then click on the 'Power' button to switch on the oscilloscope.
					 
3. Click on "Square" button(twice) to observe input signal. Apply amplitude to 5v<sub>p-p</sub>,Frequency 1Hz. 
					 
4. Apply 50 percent proportional band by rotating the 'proportional band' knob by clicking on the plus sign on it and apply integral time to 2 by rotating the 'Integral action' knob by clicking on the plus sign on it. 

5. Now click on 'Output' button to observe the output signal for that perticular integral time.Channel-1 will show the input,Channel-2 will show the output and 'Dual' shows the both.Check output by setting integral time to 5,10,25 in same way.
					

<b style="color:blue">P-I-D Control</b>

1. At first connect the circuit diagram properly through the connecting dots(blue dots)in the Process Simulator kit below the oscilloscope section,according to below instruction.
2-7,8-9,10-11,12-13,21-22,23-24,37-38,39-40,28-29,25-26,23-42,44-42,46-43,46-25 and 32-35,30-31,33-36 for proportional Integral Derivative control.45-22,45-27 connections can be done for showing output signal
or deviation signal respectively in oscilloscope channel-2 alternatively.
  
2. Click on 'Check Connection' button to check whether the connection is proper or not.Then click on the 'Power' button to switch on the oscilloscope.
					 
3. Click on "Square" button(twice) to observe input signal. Apply amplitude to 5v<sub>p-p</sub>,Frequency 1Hz. 
					 
4. Apply 50 percent proportional band by rotating the 'proportional band' knob by clicking on the plus sign on it , apply integral time to 2 by rotating the 'Integral action' knob by clicking on the plus sign on it and apply derivative time to 2 by rotating the 'Derivative action' knob by clicking on the plus sign on it.

5. Now click on 'Output' button to observe the output signal for that perticular derivative time.Channel-1 will show the input,Channel-2 will show the output and 'Dual' shows the both.Check the steady state error,percentage overshoot are decreased in the output after P-I-D Control.
